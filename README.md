# NgPhoenix2

This is a minimal, bare bones Angular 2 app embedded in a Phoenix project. It can be used as a starting point for further development with Angular 2 in Phoenix.

To get everything up and running, make sure you have Elixir and Phoenix installed.
CD into the directory and, assuming you want to use the default Postgres database setup, run mix ecto.create with an open connection to a Postgres server.

Bring in Angular 2, typings, Webpack, and other JS dependencies by running npm install.

The app can be served using the mix phoenix.server command.
